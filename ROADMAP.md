# Spindle Roadmap

## Project Mission and Summary
Spindle is an open-source cyber threat actor (CTA) tracker developed by Arachne Digital to serve the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) community. Our mission is to simplify CTA identification and attribution by providing a centralised, accurate, and community-driven repository of CTA names, aliases, and connections. Spindle integrates with the Thread application to enhance threat analysis workflows and promotes standardisation to reduce confusion within the CTI landscape. With a focus on data accuracy through human analyst review and community contributions, Spindle aims to become a widely recognised and trusted resource in global cybersecurity efforts.

## Milestones and Rationale

### Milestone 1: Security Testing and Remediation
- **Tasks**:
  - Conduct penetration testing to identify security issues.
  - Review and prioritise findings based on severity and impact.
  - Implement remediation measures to address identified issues.
  - Update security documentation to reflect findings and actions taken.

- **Rationale**: Ensuring Spindle’s security is critical to maintaining trust. Addressing security issues early establishes a secure foundation for future developments and ensures that the platform remains robust as it scales. Note that security testing will become an annual event as Arachne Digital grows.

### Milestone 2: Transition to Memory Safe Programming
- **Tasks**:
  - Audit the codebase for memory-unsafe code.
  - Prioritise critical components for migration to memory-safe languages.
  - Enhance current security practices related to memory safety.
  - Train the development team in memory-safe programming languages.
  - Align the transition with Arachne Digital’s long-term business goals.
  - Implement and monitor the migration process.

- **Rationale**: Transitioning to memory-safe programming strengthens Spindle’s security by reducing vulnerabilities related to unsafe memory management. This milestone builds on the security foundation established in Milestone 1 and ensures long-term resilience against threats.

### Milestone 3: Standardisation and Feature Expansion
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate the DISARM disinformation framework into Spindle.
  - Expand documentation to guide contributors on best practices.
  - Pilot community contributions to refine the process before broader involvement.
  - Launch community outreach initiatives to raise awareness and invite collaboration.

- **Rationale**: This milestone focuses on expanding Spindle’s capabilities and establishing a standardised framework for data collection and contribution. Integrating DISARM and engaging the community ensures that Spindle evolves with industry needs and benefits from diverse input.

### Milestone 4: Scaling and Automation
- **Tasks**:
  - Strengthen the data validation process with robust checks and clear guidelines.
  - Open contributions to a wider community, building on pilot program insights.
  - Introduce automation for repetitive tasks while maintaining human oversight.
  - Explore integration with other threat intelligence feeds, ensuring data integrity.
  - Implement systems to track KPIs and gather feedback for continuous improvement.

- **Rationale**: Scaling contributions and integrating automation enhances Spindle’s efficiency and accuracy. By building on the community engagement and standardisation from Milestone 3, this milestone ensures that Spindle can handle increased data input and maintain high-quality standards.

### Milestone 5: Advanced Features and Strategic Partnerships
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop advanced search and visualisation features for exploring CTA connections.
  - Strengthen the partnership with DISARM Foundation and incorporate their feedback.
  - Plan for long-term sustainability, including funding and governance strategies.

- **Rationale**: Introducing advanced features and strategic partnerships enhances Spindle’s functionality and relevance. This milestone builds on the expanded capabilities from previous milestones and ensures that Spindle remains a valuable resource in the evolving CTI landscape.

### Milestone 6: Enhancing Core Functionality
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop a frontend interface for adding new CTAs and associated information.
  - Automate the population of markdown and JSON files to ensure consistency.

- **Rationale**: Enhancing core functionality with a user-friendly frontend streamlines the contribution process and reduces manual effort. This milestone builds on the infrastructure and community engagement from earlier milestones, making Spindle more accessible and efficient.

### Milestone 7: Scaling and Sustainability
- **Tasks**:
  - Optimise infrastructure to handle increased traffic and usage.
  - Develop a sustainability plan including funding sources and partnerships.
  - Begin localisation efforts to translate Spindle into multiple languages.

- **Rationale**: Scaling infrastructure and planning for sustainability are critical as Spindle grows. This milestone ensures that Spindle can support a larger user base and maintain long-term relevance and reliability.

### Milestone 8: Global Impact
- **Tasks**:
  - Expand global outreach to engage international CTI communities.
  - Position Spindle as a recognised resource within the cybersecurity community.

- **Rationale**: Achieving global impact is the culmination of Spindle’s development. By expanding outreach and positioning Spindle as a key resource, this milestone ensures that Spindle’s contributions to cybersecurity are widely recognised and utilised.
