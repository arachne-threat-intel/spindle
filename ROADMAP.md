# Spindle Roadmap

## Project Mission and Summary
Spindle is an open-source cyber threat actor (CTA) tracker developed by Arachne Digital to serve the cyber threat intelligence (CTI) community. Our mission is to simplify CTA identification and attribution by providing a centralised, accurate, and community-driven repository of CTA names, aliases, and connections. Spindle integrates with the Thread application to enhance threat analysis workflows and promotes standardisation to reduce confusion within the CTI landscape. With a focus on data accuracy through human analyst review and community contributions, Spindle aims to become a widely recognised and trusted resource in global cybersecurity efforts.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1: Security Testing and Remediation
* Conduct Penetration Testing: Identify security vulnerabilities in the application through comprehensive penetration testing. Collaborate with the assigned penetration tester to perform a detailed security assessment, covering all aspects of the project.
* Review and Prioritise Findings: Understand and categorise the security risks identified during the penetration testing. Analyse the findings provided by the penetration tester, categorise them based on severity, and prioritise them for remediation based on potential impact and ease of exploitation.
* Implement Remediation Measures: Address all identified security vulnerabilities to ensure the safety and integrity of the application. Develop and deploy fixes for the identified vulnerabilities, ensuring that each issue is resolved in line with best security practices. 
* Update Security Documentation: Maintain accurate records of the security posture and mitigation steps taken for the project. Document all findings, remediation steps, and testing results, and update the security policy and procedures to reflect any new security practices or lessons learned from the testing process.

### Milestone 2: Standardisation and Feature Expansion
* DISARM Framework Integration: Begin the integration of the DISARM disinformation framework into Thread and, subsequently, into Spindle. Develop a structure within Spindle to track disinformation CTAs alongside traditional hacking CTAs.
* Enhanced Documentation: Expand Spindle’s documentation to include detailed guides for contributors, including best practices for adding and vetting CTAs. Ensure that documentation is user-friendly and accessible.
* Pilot Community Contributions: Start a pilot program to allow a select group of community members to contribute to Spindle, focusing on adding new CTAs and vetting information. Use this pilot to refine the contribution process and address any issues before broader community involvement.
* Community Outreach: Launch initiatives to increase community contributions, such as webinars, blog posts, and social media campaigns to raise awareness and invite collaboration from the CTI community.

### Milestone 3: Scaling and Automation
* Data Validation Process: Strengthen the existing process for validating CTA aliases by implementing more robust checks and clearer guidelines for contributors. Ensure that every alias is attributed to a primary source, with links for transparency.
* Scaling Up Contributions: Open up Spindle contributions to a wider community, based on the learnings from the pilot program. Promote the importance of accurate, well-sourced contributions through community channels.
* Automation Enhancements: Introduce automation for repetitive tasks, such as linking new CTAs to existing ones and checking for duplicate entries, while maintaining a human-in-the-loop system for final approvals.
* Threat Intelligence Feeds Integration: Explore integrating other threat intelligence feeds with Spindle, while maintaining human analyst oversight to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data.
* Metrics and Feedback Collection: Implement systems to track KPIs, particularly focusing on the number of active community members contributing to Spindle. Regularly review feedback from GitHub issues, Slack, and email to inform development priorities.

### Milestone 4: Advanced Features and Strategic Partnerships
* Advanced Search and Visualisation: Develop advanced search and visualisation features within Spindle, allowing users to explore connections between CTAs and understand the broader threat landscape. Current plans involve publishing Spindle data to the Arachne Digital website, but other options can be explored as well.
* Strategic Partnership with DISARM: Strengthen the partnership with DISARM Foundation, incorporating their feedback into Spindle’s development. Begin tracking disinformation CTAs and integrating this data into Thread.
* Long-Term Sustainability Planning: Start planning for the long-term sustainability of Spindle, including potential funding sources, governance structures, and strategies for maintaining relevance in the evolving CTI landscape.

### Milestone 5: Enhancing Core Functionality 
* Frontend Development: Begin developing a frontend interface that allows users to add new CTAs and associated information. This frontend will automate the population of the markdown and JSON files, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort.

### Milestone 6: Scaling and Sustainability
* Scaling Infrastructure: Optimise the infrastructure to handle increased traffic and usage, ensuring that the public instance of Spindle remains performant and reliable as its user base grows.
* Long-term Sustainability Planning: Develop a sustainability plan for Spindle, including potential funding sources, partnerships, and governance structures to ensure its continued development and maintenance.
* Global Outreach and Localisation: Begin efforts to localise Spindle, translating the interface and documentation into multiple languages to support a global user base. Engage with international privacy and open-source communities to broaden Tracery’s reach.

### Milestone 7: Global Impact
* Global Outreach: Expand outreach efforts to engage with international CTI communities, translating key documentation and interfaces to support non-English speaking users.
Recognition as a Key Resource: Focus on positioning Spindle as a recognized and widely cited resource within the cybersecurity community, promoting its use in academic research, industry reports, and other publications.
